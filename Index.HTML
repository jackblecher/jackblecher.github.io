        <font face="times new roman" color="green"><h3>Bio</h3> </font>
        <p>My name is Jack Blecher. I am currently a sophmore student at Gonzaga University studying accounting.
        I was born in San Antonio Texas, lived in England for four years, but have now been in Portland Oregon most of my life. I have two younger sisters. A fun fact about me is I have been to New Zealand before! 
        I attended Grant High School where I wrestled, played football, and was a part of the track
         team. One of my best memories from high school was being voted as the team captain for the
          wrestling team for my senior year. Now I am in college and on the brink of entering the workforce!
          </p>
          <p>My past experiences include lots of volunteer work for my community including various tasks for my church, working a cafeteria line at a food bank, and manual work for community farms. I was also the goods buyer for my high school student store where I learned a great deal about working in a team and the inner workings of a business. If you are interested in learning more, please look below.</p>

     <h2>Why Accounting?</h2>
    <p>I took accounting classes in high school which gave me my first glimpse into the field. Something that really attracted me was how incredibely versatile it is. Accounting is used in everything when it comes to business. As Warren Buffett said, "Accounting is the language of business." Accounting having high versatility allows me many different avenues when it comes to job opportunities in the future. Additionally, in my first classes I genuinely started to enjoy the accounting work. I've always had an analytical mind and accounting to me was enjoyable problem solving because there was always a right answer. I liked making all of the numbers balance out. Going forward, I am excited to start my career in accounting and plan on Gonzagas five year masters program for CPA certification. After this, I am open to many different options, but am currently looking towards the traditional route of joining one of the big four to get my career up and running. My resume and contacts are located at the top of the page if you are interested in my qualifications or getting in touch.</p>
